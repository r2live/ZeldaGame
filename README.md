# ZeldaGame

This repository is for a small dungeon crawling game that I created, with the style of the NES Legend of Zelda game.

I used code from this tutorial https://zetcode.com/javagames/pacman/, and then adapted it for the purposes of the game that I wanted to make.

The initial goal of the game is to run around the map and kill all the monsters running around. Once that happens, the boss Ganon will break free from his cage, and the map will change. The goal then becomes to defeat him. Once that happens, touch the Triforce object that appears in the middle of the room, and you win the game.
